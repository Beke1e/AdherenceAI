Local Deployment Instructions for Adherence Flask App
=====================================================

1. Prerequisites:
   - Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
   - Git (optional, if you want to clone the repository).

2. Setup Steps:

   a. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

   b. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

   c. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
      - On Windows:
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
      - On macOS/Linux:
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate

   d. Install the required Python packages:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Database:
   - The application uses SQLite database file named 'adherence_data.db'.
   - If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically when you run the app.
   - If you have an existing 'adherence_data.db' file, place it in the project root directory.

4. Running the Application:
   - Run the Flask app using the command:
     python app.py
   - The app will start on host 0.0.0.0 and port 5000.

5. Accessing the Application:
   - Open your web browser and go to:
     http://localhost:5000
   - You will be redirected to the login page.

6. Notes:
   - The app supports user registration and login.
   - Prediction data and user accounts are stored in the SQLite database.
   - To stop the app, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

7. Troubleshooting:
   - Ensure Python and pip are correctly installed and added to your system PATH.
   - If you encounter permission issues, try running the terminal as administrator.
   - For any database errors, verify the presence and permissions of 'adherence_data.db'.
